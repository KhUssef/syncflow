!!!! being done rn :
- [ ] make all endpoints have the same structure:
    - [ ]  ws : stays the same
    - [ ]  access (post/put/delete/get not getall) to particular resource (note/task...): should include id in the param ("notes/:id") 
    - [ ] getall : doesnt change

-[x] check and remove graphql
-[x] make it so a note isnt created by default byt created by admin
-[x] same for chat
-[?] check if flutter/react can give the token in the right place
-[ ] make sure that ws auth can take the token wherever it is
-[ ] check notes (i dont think there is a function to get the entire note including the lines)
