!!!! being done rn :
- [x] make all endpoints have the same structure:
    - [x]  ws : stays the same
    - [x]  access (post/put/delete/get not getall) to particular resource (note/task...): should include id in the param ("notes/:id") 
        - [x] create company access guard (to see if user has access to resource)
        - [x] change all endpoints to have this feature
        - [x] change services to not check again
    - [x] getall : doesnt change


-[x] check and remove graphql
-[x] make it so a note isnt created by default byt created by admin
-[x] same for chat
-[?] check if flutter/react can give the token in the right place
-[ ] make sure that ws auth can take the token wherever it is
-[ ] check notes (i dont think there is a function to get the entire note including the lines)
